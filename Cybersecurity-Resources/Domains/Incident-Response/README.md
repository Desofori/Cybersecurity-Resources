  1. **Preparation**: Establish response plans and tools.
  2. **Identification**: Detect incidents through monitoring and alerts.
  3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
  4. **Eradication**: Remove the root cause and any remnants of the attack.
  5. **Recovery**: Restore systems and data to a secure state.
  6. **Lessons Learned**: Document the incident and improve future response strategies.
- **[NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final)**: A comprehensive guide for incident response based on NIST standards.
