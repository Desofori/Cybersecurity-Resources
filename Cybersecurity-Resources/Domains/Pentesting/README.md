## 1. Web-Application Pentesting

### Basics for Web-App Pentesting
- Understanding **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Java**, and **PHP** gives you a significant advantage.
- Web testing can be complexâ€”follow a structured methodology.
- Familiarize yourself with fundamental web-attacks and vulnerabilities, such as:
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

## 3. Penetration Testing Guide & Checklist
A detailed framework for conducting penetration tests systematically.

### 3.1 Pre-Engagement
- **Legal and Compliance**:
  - Obtain NDAs and written authorizations.
  - Adhere to regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.
- **Scope Definition**:
  - Identify in-scope and out-of-scope systems.
  - Confirm testing constraints and methodologies.
- **Communication and Planning**:
  - Establish emergency protocols and regular reporting schedules.

### 3.2 Information Gathering
- **Passive Reconnaissance**:
  - Use tools like Shodan, Censys, and Google dorking.
  - Perform OSINT via public forums and social media.
- **Active Reconnaissance**:
  - Conduct scans using tools like Nmap and Nessus.
  - Identify technologies and possible vulnerabilities.

### 3.3 Exploitation
- Gain access using techniques such as:
  - Exploiting known vulnerabilities.
  - Brute-forcing weak credentials.
  - Leveraging exploit frameworks (e.g., Metasploit).

### 3.4 Reporting
- Provide an actionable and detailed technical report.
- Include:
  - Screenshots and logs for evidence.
  - Risk ratings and mitigation strategies.
